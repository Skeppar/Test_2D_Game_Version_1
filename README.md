# Test_2D_Game_Version_1

This is a game which I started making on the 26th of October in 2022. I just finished a Java bootcamp and this will be my first real Java project I'm making after having finished the bootcamp.

I have a lot of ideas that I want to put into this game in the future, but I will start with this test game first, and then later on make a second one using everything I learnt from this. 

Disclaimer: Much of this code will be based on a YouTubers work where he teaches coding. I am planning on taking what I learn from this project and making it into something original in the future, but at that point I will most likely make a new project here on GitHub for it. If you are interested in the YouTubers work you can find all of his videos on his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RyiSnow/videos
