# Test_2D_Game_Version_1

I have a lot of ideas that I want to put into this game in the future, but I will start with this more simplistic game first, and then later on make a new one using everything I learned from this project. 

Much of this code is based on a YouTuber's work who teaches coding. I have made changes and adaptations to the code, and I have a ton of ideas that I am planning on implimenting in the future. I highly recommend his channel for anyone interested in coding simplistic games in Java, the code is not too complicated and his videos are very easy to understand, you can find his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RyiSnow/videos
