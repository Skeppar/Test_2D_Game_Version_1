# Test_2D_Game_Version_1

This is a game which I started making on the 26th of October in 2022. I just finished a Java bootcamp and this will be my first real Java project I'm making after 
having finished the bootcamp.

Disclaimer: Much of this code will be based on a YouTubers work where he teaches coding. I am planning on taking what I learn from this project and making it into 
something original in the future, but at that point I will most likely make a new project here on HitHub for it. If you are interested in the YouTubers work you 
can find all of his videos on his channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/RyiSnow/videos
